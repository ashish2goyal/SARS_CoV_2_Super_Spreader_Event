This is a R script that reproduces a distribution of inidividual R0, serial interval and generation time. In its current form, on lines 118-131, we provide five inputs as listed in the manuscript. The readers can make change to the parameter values that they need to explore, and the output for all parameter cobinations will be stored in Output_File_search.csv.
